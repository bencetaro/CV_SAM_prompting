# CV_SAM_prompting
Showcasing SAM segmentation model on kaggle dataset

I created this notebook because I wanted to demonstrate how to use the Segment Anything Model by Meta AI Research for image segmentation purposes.

SAM github repo: https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/tree/main

Dataset for the task: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alex000kim/magnetic-tile-surface-defects
